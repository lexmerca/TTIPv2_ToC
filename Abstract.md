## [Abstract](https://github.com/lexmerca/TTIPv2_ToC)

In 2016, negotiations toward a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement between the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) ended without conclusion. Cross-border data flows have since become a greater driver of international commercial activity, the digitalization of trade has accelerated, and the global ‘digital economy’ has expanded. To re-engage and coordinate responses, the EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC) was established in 2021. The TTC seeks to grow bilateral relations by mitigating technical barriers between the jurisdiction(s), strengthening transatlantic supply chains, fostering cooperation on data issues, setting standards, promoting digital tools for small business inclusion, and reforming the rules-based multilateral trading system. Concurrently, Computational Law (CompLaw) approaches are emerging that allow entities to express and publish digital versions of rules online *as* algorithms to improve accessibility for humans and support operationalization via machines. As instruments begin to refer to governance *for*, *of*, and *by* information and communications technology (ICT), this working paper introduces public and private branches of law to construct a five-point legal-technical basis for a TTIP 'version 2.0' with computational rules in parallel to its natural language text. First, the nature of the EU-US relationship is described in the context of the age of Computational Law and the Internet. Second, the analysis explores the multilateral interface and proposals under the World Trade Organization (WTO) Joint Statement Initiative on E-commerce. Third, existing and envisaged EU and US legislation, case law, and Customs systems are compared. Fourth, the investigation frames institutional sources of transnational commercial law, including the principles, conventions, and model laws of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT). Fifth, technical requirements to seize the CompLaw opportunity for transatlantic trade are articulated. The research contributes to the advancement of legal informatics at the nexus of EU-US trade and technology policy regimes.
